# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
# Example 2:

# Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
# Output: 9
 

# Constraints:

# n == height.length
# 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
# 0 <= height[i] <= 105

# solution
def trap(height):
    if not height:
        return 0
    
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    left_max, right_max = height[left], height[right]
    water_trapped = 0
    
    while left < right:
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
            left_max = max(left_max, height[left])
            water_trapped += left_max - height[left]
        else:
            right -= 1
            right_max = max(right_max, height[right])
            water_trapped += right_max - height[right]
    
    return water_trapped
