# The judge will test your solution with the following code:

# int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
# int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

# int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

# assert k == expectedNums.length;
# for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
#     assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
# }
# If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
# Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
# Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
# It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
# Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]
# Explanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
# It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
# -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
# nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
